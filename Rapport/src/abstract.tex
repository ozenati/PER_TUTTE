\section*{abstract}

The article we are currently working on deals with how to visualize graphs containing many nodes and edges. With huge amount of data generally comes visual clutter, in our case due to edges crossing. This solution is based on an edge bundling technique coupled with a grid built from the original graph. Authors also used a GPU-based rendering method to highlight bundles densities without losing edge color. We use in our solution the Tutte algorithm in order to quickly obtain a graph without crossing, based on a triangular-face grid, which helps to read relationship between nodes. This algorithm will be available as a Tulip plugin.
