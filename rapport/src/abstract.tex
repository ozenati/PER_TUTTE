The article we are currently working on deals with how to visualize graphs containing many nodes and edges. With huge amounts of data generally comes visual clutter, in our case due to edge crossing. This solution is based on an edge bundling technique coupled with a grid built from the original graph. The authors also used a GPU-based rendering method to highlight bundle densities without losing edge color. Our solution uses the Tutte algorithm in order to quickly obtain a graph without crossing, based on a triangular-face grid, which helps to read relationships between nodes. This algorithm is available as a standalone program for Tulip.
