\chapter*{Conclusion}


With our best Tutte algorithm implementation, we obtain an algorithm convergence in 5 iterations and it spends x seconds to recalculate all the coordinates. \textbf{(à mettre à jour)}
Finally, our optimizations allowed an improvement of the clutter reduction and the performance compared with existing methods.


After discussing with our teachers in charge, some issues concerning our standalone version remain unsolved and could be taken into account in the future. Rather than work with input graph nodes, it would be interesting to dynamically add nodes (and their edges to keep a triangular-face graph) and to launch again the algorithm in order to refine the given results. It would also be quite interesting to automatically join small triangles or divide big triangles into smaller ones.

Another valuable improvement would be to turn our standalone program into a Tulip plugin in order to integrate it in this software.
 
A theoretical point remains unsolved : despite the fact that the contour on which we apply the Tutte algorithm is not necessarily convex, we obtain correct results. It would be useful to understand why Tutte works on such kind of graphs: It could be caused by how the grid is built or by the following constraint: two fixed nodes can not be linked by an edge.
