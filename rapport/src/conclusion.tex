\chapter*{Conclusion}


With our best Tutte algorithm implementation , we obtain an algorithm convergence in 5 iterations and it spends x seconds to recalculate all the coordinates.
Finally, our optimizations allowed an improvement of the clutter reduction and the performance compared with existent methods.
After discussing with our teachers in charge, some issues concerning our plug-in remains unresolved and could be taken into account in the future: Rather than working with input graph nodes, it would be interesting to dynamically add nodes (and their edges to keep a triangular-face graph) and launch again the algorithm in order to refine given results. It will also be quite interesting to automatically join small triangles or divide big triangles into littles ones.
