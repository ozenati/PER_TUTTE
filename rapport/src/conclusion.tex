\chapter*{Conclusion}


With our best Tutte algorithm implementation , we obtain an algorithm convergence in 5 iterations and it spends x seconds to recalculate all the coordinates. \textbf{(à mettre à jour)}
Finally, our optimizations allowed an improvement of the clutter reduction and the performance compared with existent methods.


After discussing with our teachers in charge, some issues concerning our standalone version remains unresolved and could be taken into account in the future: Rather than working with input graph nodes, it would be interesting to dynamically add nodes (and their edges to keep a triangular-face graph) and launch again the algorithm in order to refine given results. It will also be quite interesting to automatically join small triangles or divide big triangles into littles ones. 

\textbf{(à rajouter: plugin, prouver que ca marche: peut etre dû à la construction de la grille (triangulation de delaunay + contrainte: deux sommets fixes ne sont jamais reliés par une arête sauf sur le contour))}
