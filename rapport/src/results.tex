\subsection{Benchmark}

The authors provided us with three graphs in order to test our
different implementations of the Tutte method.\\

These graphs have the following characteristics :

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Graph & number of vertices & number of edges \\
\hline
aiir\_traffic & 14693 & 63403\\
imdb & 9488 & 33942\\
migration & 14318 & 49460\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


For the first implementation with a basic structure to
work on the graph, we obtain these results~:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Graph & number of iterations & mean time of execution of Tutte's algorithm & standard deviation\\
\hline
aiir\_traffic & 61 & 0.2526 & 0\\
imdb & 473 & 1.2957 & 0\\
migration & 5 & 0.006314 & 0\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
%\caption{title}
\end{center}

\subsection{Not planar graph}
The results we get here are not as good as we expected. Although the
computation time is quite improved, the produced graphs are not planar. The
reason is that the provided graph has some fixed nodes inside the
grid. Consequently, after the call of our implementation of the Tutte
Algorithm, some edges crossing (due to those fixed nodes) appear and remove
the planarity of the graph.

As an explanation, we can say that moving nodes tend to be oriented to the 
side which has the highest level of fixed nodes.(see the figure \ref{mauvais_1}). 
With such a graph, a mobile node which is opposite to the side with numerous
edges will move to this side and create an edge-crossing (see the figure \ref{mauvais_2}).

\end{figure}

%\newpage 

You can notice that if all the nodes in the interior of boundaries are mobile, then the graph produced stay planar (see figure \ref{correct_1} and \ref{correct_2}).
