\subsection{Some extreme cases about Tutte's theorem}
In our case we do not use 3-connected graph but graph whose interior faces are triangle. It is obvious that considering this king of graph Tutte's theorem is verified.
\subsubsection{Tutte's theorem and concave polygon}
Changing the hypothesis of the Tutte's theorem above, we try to prove that
