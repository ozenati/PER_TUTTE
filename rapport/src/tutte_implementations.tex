%\subsection{Sequentiel version}
%in this first optimization Frozar you are suggested to put the improvement due to the new data structure you took
In the sequential version, the algorithm presented is an asynchronous Tutte one. In fact, there is a second approach, the synchronous Tutte version. The difference between the two approaches is :
\begin{itemize}
\item in asynchronous version: each movement is applied directy after being computed
\item in synchronous version: all movement are computed before being applied
\end{itemize}
In the sequential version, the synchronous approach does not present benefits. It is more convenient to consider neighbors movement.
In the parallel version, the synchronous approach may be interesting in order to reduce critical sections.
\subsection{Asynchronous parallel version}
%in this optimization Frozar you are suggested to talk about results with openMP

\subsection{Synchronous parallel version}
%in this optimization Ozenati you are suggested to talk about the asynchronous implementation (if faster than the others) with graph coloration
