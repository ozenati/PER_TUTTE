\section{Tutte Sequential}

To obtain the graph resulted of the Tutte's theorem, an algorithm is
needed. In this section, a sequential algorithm is described. This
algorithm is an iterative solution. To compute a solution, a set of node
that constitute a convex polygon must be decided. Let $P$ this set of node. Let
$G_k$ be the graph generated at the step $k$.
\\

To obtain the graph of the next step, all the node of the interior of the
convex polygon $P$ will be visited. For each node visited, the barycentric
coordinates of its neighbourhood is computed. Then this coordinates is used
to update the position of the current node. Once each node were visited,
the computation of the graph $G_{k+1}$ is finished.
\\
In this project, the stop condition used for this algorithm is an epsilon
between the relative positions of the node of the graph $G_k$ and
$G_{k+1}$. For all node of the graph, if the length of each movement is
inferior to a given epsilon, the graph $G_{k+1}$ is the solution.
\\

Following is a synthetic view of this algorithm : 
\begin{verbatim}
G = {V,E}
P = set of node constitute a convex polygon
procedure tutte(G, P, epsilon)
  epsilon_current = 0
  for each node of (V \ convex polygon)
    barycenter = barycenter of node
    epsilon_current = max(epsilon_current, distance(node, barycenter)
    node = barycenter
  if (epsilon_current < epsilon)
    exit()
  tutte(G, P, epsilon)
\end{verbatim}


% Le but ici est d'exposé la méthode algorithmique qui découle de l'algorithme de Tutte et  de prouver que cette méthode converge (retrouver l'article qui en parle)
